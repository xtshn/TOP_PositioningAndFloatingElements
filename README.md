# TOP_PositioningAndFloatingElement

The project was a bit challenging especially in the Chart parts. The project is basically referenced by the final work of Andrija Jelenkovic.  


### What I learned from the project.
- 'inline-block' for making horizontal navigation. 
- Using Grid in the navigation, chart, article-suggestions, footer part. 
- Creating a div for container first in order to draw a frame.
